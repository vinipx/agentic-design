# Introduction

Agentic Design provides unified guidelines for integrating AI agents into QA and SDET workflows across multiple platforms.

## Why Agentic Design?

As AI capabilities become intrinsic to software testing, teams need:

- **Consistency** — Same patterns across Cursor, Gemini, Claude, Copilot, and OpenAI
- **Safety** — Deterministic verification, context bounding, and security practices
- **Productivity** — Templates and examples that work out of the box

## Who Is This For?

- **QA Engineers** — Automating test authoring, flaky investigation, and CI triage
- **SDETs** — Framework scaffolding, migration, and agentic workflows
- **DevOps Engineers** — CI/CD integration with AI-powered failure analysis

## How to Use This Documentation

1. **Start with [Foundations](/docs/foundations/agents-mcp-workflows)** — Understand agents, MCPs, and agentic workflows
2. **Check the [Comparative Matrix](/docs/getting-started/comparative-matrix)** — Pick the right provider for your use case
3. **Follow provider-specific [Tutorials](/docs/tutorials/first-run-cursor)** — Set up your chosen platform
4. **Apply [Use Cases](/docs/use-cases/e2e-scaffolding)** — Implement real-world scenarios

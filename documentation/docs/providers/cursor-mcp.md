# MCP Integrations for QA

[Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://cursor.com/docs/context/mcp/directory) lets the agent connect to external tools. QA-relevant servers:

| Server | Use Case |
|--------|----------|
| **Playwright** | `npx -y @playwright/mcp@latest` — E2E test authoring and execution |
| **Sentry** | Investigate errors and stack traces from production |
| **Browserbase** | Headless browser sessions for agents |
| **Chrome DevTools** | Debug web pages, performance insights |

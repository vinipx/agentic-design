# Playwright Spec Standards

- Use `page.getByRole()` or `page.getByTestId()` for locators; avoid raw CSS selectors.
- Use Playwright's auto-retrying assertions: `expect(locator).toBeVisible()`, `.toHaveText()`.
- Never use `page.waitForTimeout()` — use `expect().toBeVisible()` or explicit waits.
- Follow Arrange-Act-Assert with blank lines between sections.
- Run `npx playwright test <file>` before considering changes complete.

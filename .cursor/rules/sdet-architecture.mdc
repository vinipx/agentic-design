# SDET Framework Architecture

## Directory Structure
- `/tests`: Only spec files (`*.spec.ts`).
- `/pages`: Page Object classes.
- `/fixtures`: Custom Playwright fixtures.
- `/utils`: Helper functions (data generation, API clients).

## Commands
- `npm run test`: Run full suite
- `npx playwright test <file>`: Run single file (prefer for iteration)
- `npx playwright test --project=chromium`: Run Chromium only
